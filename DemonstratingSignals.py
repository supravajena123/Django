#Code Snippet and Logic how Django Signals work. Let's divide into the part to understand logic and the whole concept. recently I have obtained Certified Network Security Practioner from SecOps and also learned lot's of concepts and practical scenerio, so I am using the security example to demonstrate the django signals.

#you will need to import neccessary libraries 

import time
#Importing the signal module from Django
from django.dispatch import signal

#Defining a signal for suspicious activity detection and This signal will be sent when suspicious activity is detected
suspicious_activity = signal(providing_args=["data"])

#Defining a receiver function to alert the security team and This function will be called when the signal is sent
def alert_security_team(sender, data):
    print(f"Alerting: Suspicious traffic detected from {data['source_ip']} to {data['destination_ip']}") #message to security team 

#Defining a function to analyze network traffic 
def analyze_network_traffic(data):
    if data['packet_data'] == 'malicious_packet':
        suspicious_activity.send(sender="suspicious activity detected", data=data)

#Creating the a sample traffic data
data = {
    'source_ip': '192.168.1.100',
    'destination_ip': '8.8.8.8',
    'packet_data': 'malicious_packet'
}

#Calling the analyze network traffic function with the sample data
analyze_network_traffic(data)


#Since the signal is sent synchronously

#When the analyze_network_traffic function sends a signal, it waits for the alert_security_team function to finish its job before continuing. This can cause problems if the alert_security_team function takes a long time to finish or uses a lot of resources, because it blocks the analyze_network_traffic function from doing its next tasks.

#I have just used the security example to demonstrate the Django signals are synchronous by default. 

#In Django, we can use the django-channels library to send signals asynchronously using WebSockets or other message brokers. However, this would require significant changes to the above code and infrastructure but as required in the first question to demonstrate the django Signals are synchronous and asynchronous by default that I have demonstrated.
