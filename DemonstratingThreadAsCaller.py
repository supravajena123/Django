#Code Snippet and Logic how Thread work as caller work. Let's divide into the part to understand logic and the whole concept.

import threading
from django.dispatch import Signal

#Define a signal
suspicious_traffic_detected_tac = Signal()

def alert_security_team(sender, **kwargs): #this is the sender of the signal, and This is a dictionary of keyword arguments
    #function to get current thread ID
    thread_id = threading.get_ident()
    print(f"Security team alerted from thread ID - {thread_id}")

    # now sending an alert to the security team
    print("Alert has been sent - Suspicious traffic detected")

#Packet_data - This is a dictionary containing information about the network traffic.
def analyze_network_traffic(packet_data): 
    # Function to get the current thread ID
    thread_id = threading.get_ident()
    print(f"Analyzing network traffic from thread ID - {thread_id}")

    #Now, Checking if the packet data is malicious
    if packet_data["malicious"]:
        # Send the signal
        suspicious_traffic_detected_tac.send(sender=None)

#Connecting to the signal receiver
suspicious_traffic_detected_tac.connect(alert_security_team)

#Now, analyzing network traffic
packet_data = {"malicious": True}
analyze_network_traffic(packet_data)

#So, the output of the code will show that both the analyze_network_traffic function and the alert_security_team function have the same thread ID, hence it's shown that Django signals run in the same thread as the caller.
